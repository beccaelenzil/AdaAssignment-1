#1.Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than 70, print PASSING; otherwise, print NOT PASSING.#

puts "Please choose a number ? >"
x = gets.chomp.to_i

if x>70

#2. Prompt for a string. If the string is equal to green, print GO, otherwise, print STOP.#

puts "Please enter a word: >"
word = gets.chomp

end

#3. Prompt for a number. If the number is even, print EVEN, otherwise, print ODD.#

puts "Please enter a number: >"
y = gets.chomp.to_i

if y%2 == 0
    puts "EVEN!"

else

end

#4.Prompt for a number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print MULTIPLE OF 5, otherwise, print NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5.#


puts "Please enter a number: >"

#5.Prompt for a number. If the number is less than 10, print ONE DIGIT. 
#If the number is 100 or greater, print THREE DIGITS, otherwise print TWO DIGITS.#

#6.Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is 12, 71, or 80, 
#print That number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!, otherwise do nothing.#

#7.Prompt for a state. If the state is Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, 
#print This state is in the PNW, otherwise print You should move to the PNW; itâ€™s great here!

end

#9. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay. 
#Provide time-and-a-half for hours worked beyond 40 
#(e.g., if you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week, you would gross $475 (40 x 10 + 5 x 15).

puts "please enter your rate of pay here:  "
rate = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "please enter how many hours you work a week here: "
hours = gets.chomp.to_i

if hours < 40
    gp= hours * rate
    puts "You made $#{gp} this week"

else
    gp= (40* rate) + ((hours-40)* rate*1.5)
    puts "you made $#{gp} this week"

end

#10. Rewrite the solution to the previous problem adding this modification: 
# do not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than 60, 
#instead display the message Please see manager.


puts "please enter your rate of pay here:  "
rate = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "please enter how many hours you work a week here: "
hours = gets.chomp.to_i

if hours < 40
    gp= hours * rate
    puts "You made $#{gp} this week"

elsif hours>60
    puts "Please see manager!"

else
    gp= (40* rate) + ((hours-40)* rate*1.5)
    puts "you made $#{gp} this week"
